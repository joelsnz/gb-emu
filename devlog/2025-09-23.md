# Devlog 2025-09-23
## Changes
- Started to log my work :)
## To-Do
- Change lcd_t with ppu_t from emu_t (emu.h).
- Swap the content from lcd and ppu.
## Notes
- Lcd should't be inside emu_t, as it isn't part of the gameboy architechture, instead ppu_t should be there.
- The ppu is who processes the graphics, in communication with the other modules.
- Then, the lcd extracts the info from the ppu to draw it with SDL (SDL should be on lcd.h, not ppu.h!!!).
- lcd.h only draws on screen using SDL, anything else is done by ppu.h (all the graphics processing).
